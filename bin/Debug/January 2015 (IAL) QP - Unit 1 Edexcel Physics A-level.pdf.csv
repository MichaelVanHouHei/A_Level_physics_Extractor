0,a,," A manufacturer of spring balances needs to select a spring that produces an extension 
of 0.80 cm for each 100 g mass added.
  Show that the manufacturer will need to select a spring with a spring constant of 
í
about 120 N m .
",,3,
0,b,," The manufacturer states that the maximum mass that can be hung on the spring 
balance is 1.2 kg.
  Explain why it is necessary to state the maximum mass.

12,a,," Complete the table to describe the energy transfers of the bungee jumper.  Ignore any 
changes that could be due to air resistance.
",,2,
12,b,(i)," Show that the maximum transfer of gravitational potential energy during a safe 
jump is about 30 kJ.
",,2,
12,b,(ii)," Hence calculate the tension in the rope when the bungee jumper is 10 m above 
the ground. 
   initial length of rope = 23 m

15,a,," On the diagram below draw the path the ball should take if a goal is to be scored.
",,1,
15,b,(i)," Show that the time taken to travel the horizontal distance of 1.5 m is about 0.7 s.
",,3,
15,b,(ii)," Calculate the vertical displacement of the ball when it has travelled a horizontal 
distance of 1.5 m and hence comment on whether a goal will be scored.
   vertical distance of ring from release point = 0.70 m
",,4,
15,b,(iii)," Explain how air resistance would have affected the calculation in (b)(i).
",,2,
16,a,(i)," State what is meant by high tensile strength.
",,1,
16,a,(ii)," Spiders use silk to build webs to catch insects.  Use the graph to explain how the properties 
of spider silk make it more suitable than silkworm silk for building webs to catch insects. 
",,4,
16,b,(i)," Use the graph to determine the Young modulus of spider silk for small stresses.
",,2,
16,b,(ii)," An insect flies into a spider’s web and becomes attached to a single thread.  This 
creates a tension in the thread of 580 μN.  The thread extends by approximately 
3% of the original length.
   Calculate the radius of a single thread of spider silk.
",,4,
17,a,(i)," Show that the work done by the swimmer on the water during each stroke is 
about 90 J.
",,2,
17,a,(ii)," The stroke rate of the swimmer is 55 strokes per minute.  Calculate the power 
developed by the swimmer’s arms.
",,2,
17,b,(i)," Use the graph to describe and explain the motion of the swimmer when 
performing Glide 1 and Glide 2.

18,a,(i)," Complete the free-body force diagram below for an oil drop falling freely through 
the air.
",,2,
18,a,(ii)," Explain why the oil drop reaches a terminal velocity. 
",,2,
18,b,(i)," The oil drop takes 11.9 s to fall a distance of 10.2 mm.  
í
Show that the terminal velocity of the oil drop is about 0.001 m s .
",,2,
18,b,(ii)," Assuming that the upthrust is negligible, show that the radius of the oil drop is 
about 3 μm.
í
   density of oil = 920 kg m
í
   viscosity of air = 1.82 × 10 Pa s
",,4,
18,b,(iii)," It is very difficult to measure the radius of such an oil drop directly.  
Suggest why.
",,2,
18,c,," Explain why it was necessary for Millikan to maintain the air between the plates at a 
constant temperature.
",,2,
18,d,," A student tried to model Millikan’s method for finding the radius of the oil drop.  The 
student dropped a ball bearing and recorded the time it took to pass between two light 
gates, a known distance apart. 
  Explain why this is not a good model for Millikan’s method.
