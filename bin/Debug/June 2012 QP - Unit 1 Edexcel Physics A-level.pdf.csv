14,a,," Explain whether the elastic waistband obeys Hooke’s law.
",,2,
14,b,," Show that, in this investigation, the work done on the elastic waistband in stretching 
it is less than 3 J.
",,2,
14,c,," Suggest how the elastic properties of the waistband help in keeping the trousers in 
place. 
",,2,
14,d,," The line for the decreasing force is lower than the line for the increasing force.
  Explain the significance of this.

15,a,(i)," Add flow lines to the diagram to show laminar flow changing to turbulent flow 
after passing the obstruction.
",,2,
15,a,(ii)," Explain what is meant by laminar flow and turbulent flow.
",,2,
15,b,(i)," Describe how you would expect the velocity of blood flow to vary with the 
viscosity. 
",,1,
15,b,(ii)," Suggest and explain how a rise in the temperature of the blood would affect the 
velocity of flow.
",,2,
16,a,(i)," Show that the horizontal component of the initial velocity of the rocket is about 
–1
2 m s . 
",,2,
16,a,(ii)," Show that the vertical component of the initial velocity of the rocket is about 
–1
4 m s .
",,2,
17,a,(i)," Add labelled arrows to show the three forces acting on the particle as it falls 
through the water.
",,2,
17,a,(ii)," Explain why a particle held stationary in water and then released accelerates 
downwards at first but then reaches a steady downwards speed.
",,4,
17,c,," The different types of particles in soil can be defined according to their diameters, as 
in the following table.
Soil particle Particle diameter
clay less than 0.002 mm
silt 0.002 mm – 0.05 mm
sand 0.05 mm – 2.00 mm
fine pebbles 2.00 mm – 5.00 mm
medium pebbles 5.00 mm – 20.00 mm
coarse pebbles 20.00 mm – 75.00 mm
  The photograph shows that when soil is allowed to settle in water, the pebbles tend 
to be found towards the bottom, followed by sand, silt and clay in succession.
  Explain why this happens. Assume that all particles have the same density.
",,3,
18,a,," The weight of the mass hanging on the spring is 3.90 N.
  It produces an extension of 12.2 cm.
–1
  Show that the spring constant is about 30 N m .
",,2,
18,b,(i)," Show that the spring exerts a force of about 4 N on the mass during the start 
phase.
",,2,
18,b,(ii)," Show how the average acceleration during the start phase is calculated. 
   mass hanging on spring = 0.40 kg
",,2,
18,b,(iii)," Use the values in the table to calculate the speed at the end of the start phase.
