12,b,(i)," On the picture, mark the position of the centre of gravity of the snooker cue.

10,b,(i),"	Calculate	the	extra	carbon	dioxide	emitted	by	the	3	cars	due	to	travelling	at	this	
reduced speed for 10 minutes.
",,4,
10,b,(ii),"	If	the	cyclist	had	made	the	same	journey	in	his	car	at	18	m	s , his car would 
have emitted 0.54 kg of carbon dioxide.  Comment on the significance of this.

14,a,,"	On	the	Moon,	an	astronaut	dropped	a	golf	ball.		He	later	wrote	“When	I	dropped	the	
ball, it took about three seconds to land.”
  Show that the astronaut would need to be over 7 m tall for the ball to take 3 s to land.
",,2,
14,b,(i),"	Show	that	the	astronaut’s	suggested	time	of	flight	of	30	s	is	over	twice	the	actual	
value.
",,3,
14,c,,"	A	projectile	would	have	a	greater	range	on	the	Moon	than	the	Earth	because	of	the	
lower gravitational field strength and because of the lack of an atmosphere.
  Explain how each of these factors would increase the range of the projectile.
",,3,
15,a,,"	The	student	notices	that	her	graph	is	a	straight	line	between	A	and	B	and	concludes	
that	the	device	obeys	Hooke’s	law.
  Comment on this conclusion.
",,2,
15,c,,"	The	student	eats	a	packet	of	crisps	and	then	uses	the	exercise	device.		The	energy	
content in a packet of crisps is 540 kJ.  During exercise this energy is converted and 
25% of it is transferred to mechanical work.
  The student extends the device fully 15 times in 1 minute.  An accurate value for the 
work done in fully extending the device is 14.7 J.
  Calculate the time it would take the student, working at this rate, to transfer 25% of 
the energy from the crisps to mechanical work.
",,3,
15,d,,"	Explain	whether	more	or	less	work	would	be	done	applying	the	same	maximum	
total stretching force to a similar exercise device with rubber cords of twice the 
cross-sectional area.

system.

16,a,(iii),"	Suggest	why	the	power	in	(ii)	is	a	minimum	value.
",,1,
16,b,,"	The	force	required	to	launch	‘Stealth’	is	not	always	the	same.		The	ride	is	monitored	
and the data from preceding launches is used to calculate the required force.
  If the mass of the passengers for a particular ride is significantly more than for 
preceding launches, this can lead to ‘rollback’.  This is when the carriages do not 
quite reach the top of the first slope and return backwards to the start.
  Explain why ‘rollback’ would occur in this situation.
",,3,
16,c,,"	Suggest	why	roller	coasters	may	have	a	greater	acceleration	when	the	lubricating	oil	
between the moving parts has had time to warm up.
",,2,
17,a,(i),"	Complete	a	free	body	force	diagram	for	the	mass	when	the	car	starts	moving.

the mass is produced.

17,a,,"(iii),
	(c)	Explain	why	the	string	would	not become horizontal, however great the acceleration.

each other.
