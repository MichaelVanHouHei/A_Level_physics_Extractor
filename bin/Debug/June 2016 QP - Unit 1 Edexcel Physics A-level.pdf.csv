0,a,," A sample of lunar rock was observed to have a mass of 35 pounds.
  Calculate the weight of the sample on the Moon.
  1 pound = 0.45 kg
",,3,
0,b,," The sample measured in part (a) was brought to Earth.
  Suggest how the measurements could be scaled so that the same spring balance could 
be used to measure the mass of the sample on Earth.
",,1,
0,c,," Instead of rescaling the spring balance for use on Earth, the spring could be replaced.
  Suggest, with a reason, a difference between springs selected for use in spring 
balances on Earth and those for use on the Moon.

0,a,," With reference to the shape of the graph, describe the behaviour of the wire under 
increasing stress.  You may indicate on the graph the region you are describing.
",,3,
0,b,," Describe how the graph could be used to determine the Young modulus for the wire.
",,2,
0,c,," On the axes above, sketch the graph for a brittle material with a greater Young 
modulus than the wire.

0,a,," A lorry stops at point A.
  Draw a free-body force diagram for the forces acting on the bridge at point A.
",,3,
0,b,," Explain why the structure of the bridge allows it to withstand greater loads.

0,a,," State what is meant by viscosity.
",,1,
0,b,(i)," Explain why this method can be used to determine the viscosity of the paint.
",,2,
0,b,(ii)," The time taken for the paint to drain from the cup was 17 s.  The following day 
the same paint took 24 s to drain from the cup.
   Suggest why the times were different.
",,1,
0,c,," The viscosity cup is a basic way of measuring viscosity.
  Suggest two possible sources of error with this method and state how each error 
would affect the time being measured.

 (b) After reaching terminal velocity, a raindrop took 2.6 minutes to fall 1100 m to the 
ground.
  (i) Calculate the terminal velocity of the raindrop.
",,2,
0,c,," The shape of the raindrop depends on its velocity.
  Once at terminal velocity the raindrop is flat at the bottom due to laminar air flow 
around it and remains curved at the top due to turbulent air flow.
  Add to the diagram below to show the air flow around the falling raindrop.

130 J.
",,3,
0,b,(ii)," When the spring is at its original length, as shown in position 2, the child is at his 
maximum speed.
   State the energy transfers that occur as the child moves upwards from position 1 to 
position 2.
",,2,
0,c,," Between positions 1 and 2 the pogo stick is pushing down on the ground.
  With reference to Newton’s laws of motion, explain how this downward force causes 
the child and pogo stick to rise.
