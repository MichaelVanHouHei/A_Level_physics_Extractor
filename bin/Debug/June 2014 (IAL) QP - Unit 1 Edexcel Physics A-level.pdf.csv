14,a,," A moving walkway transports people horizontally over a short distance.
í1
 A child stands on a walkway that is moving at a constant speed of 1.9 m s .  Halfway 
along the walkway the child turns around and attempts to walk back towards the start of 
1í
the walkway at a steady speed of 1.9 m s .
 Explain why the child will not reach the start of the walkway.
",,2,
14,b,(i)," A child walks up the ramp at a steady speed of 1.9 m s , taking 25 s to reach the 
next floor.
   Show that the work done by the child is about 5 kJ.
   mass of child = 45 kg

trolley using t.
",,2,
15,c,," The time t could have been measured using a stopwatch.

   density of fresh water = 997 kg m
",,2,
16,a,(ii)," On average the water will drop through a height of 185 m.
   Show that the total power of the falling water before entering the turbines is about 
2 GW.
",,2,
16,b,," Electrical energy could be produced in the same way using salt water.  The viscosity 
of salt water is greater than the viscosity of fresh water.
  Explain, without further calculation, why the different viscosity of the water would 
cause the power output using salt water to be less than the power output using fresh 
water.
