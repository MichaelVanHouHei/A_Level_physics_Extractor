13,a,(i)," Using measurements from the tape show that the final velocity of the trolley is 
–1
about 1 m s

13,b,," Using a ticker tape timer is one method of measuring the speed of a moving object in 
a laboratory.  Another method is to use a light gate with a data logger and computer.
  Suggest an advantage of using the light gate method rather than using a ticker tape 
timer.

15,c,," Diesel is used as the fuel in some vehicles.  Diesel is not renewable, so alternatives 
are being researched.  Biodiesel is a fuel made from vegetable oil; biodiesel on its 
own is not suitable for use in vehicles. 
  The table gives some information about diesel, biodiesel and ethanol. 
Viscosity / mPa s Viscosity / mPa s Energy / Freezing

Diesel 4.9 2.6 43 –30
Biodiesel 17.3 4.6 39 –12
Ethanol 1.8 0.9 27 –114
  Blends of biodiesel with ethanol are being researched as a renewable alternative to 
diesel fuels for use in vehicles all year round. 
  Using the information in the table, suggest why these blends are being researched.

16,b,," Calculate the horizontal distance jumped by the athlete.
",,2,
16,c,," In reality, when the athlete lands his centre of gravity is 50 cm lower than its position 
at take-off.
  Calculate the extra horizontal distance this enables the athlete to jump.
