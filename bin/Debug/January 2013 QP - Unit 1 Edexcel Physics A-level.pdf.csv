13,a,(i)," Explain how the acceleration of free fall could be determined using the 
recording. 
",,4,
13,b,," Describe one property of the steel ball that makes it suitable to use in this 
experiment and explain why this property makes it suitable. 
",,2,
13,c,," Explain an advantage of using a video camera to take measurements for this 
experiment rather than using a stopwatch.

  The diagram shows the tenth picture of the man.
  It is useful to mark the centre of gravity of the man for each picture before taking 
measurements to analyse the motion. 
  State what is meant by centre of gravity and mark its approximate position on the 
diagram.

16,b,," The vertical distance between consecutive pictures increases, but the horizontal 
distance remains the same.  Explain this observation.
",,2,
16,c,," By considering the vertical motion for pictures 2 to 10, show that the pictures are 
taken at a rate of about 3 per second.
  vertical height fallen = 30 m
",,3,
16,d,," The vertical height between the second and tenth pictures is 30 m.  Take measurements 
from the photograph and use them to show that the horizontal distance between these 
pictures is between 12 m and 15 m.
  Record your measurements below.

17,a,(i)," The wind exerts a force per unit area of 84 N m on the sail, which is at right 
angles to the wind direction.
   Show that the component of force in a northerly direction is about 1400 N.

18,b,(iii)," The student launches the marble vertically in order to determine the energy 
transferred to it when it is launched.  Show that the maximum possible height 
attainable is about 2 m.
   mass of marble = 3.8 g
",,2,
18,b,(i)," Explain why the student obtained a value of 30.0 cm for the height reached. 
",,2,
18,b,(ii)," Explain why the height reached is so much less than 2 m.
",,2,
18,b,(iii)," Suggest how the marble launcher could be adapted so that the height reached by 
the marble could be increased.
