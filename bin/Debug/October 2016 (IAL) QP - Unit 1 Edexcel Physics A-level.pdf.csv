0,a,," Describe the differences between the flow of the liquid through the large diameter 
pipe and the smaller diameter pipe.
",,3,
0,b,,"  Suggest a possible reason, other than the diameter, for the difference in the flow 
between the two pipes.
",,1,
0,a,," Calculate the minimum power output of the pump.
",,3,
0,b,," Explain why the power output calculated in (a) is a minimum value.

0,a,," The diagrams below show the positions of the athletes as they pass over the bar.  The 
approximate position of the centre of gravity of the athlete using the Fosbury flop has 
been drawn.
  Mark the approximate position of the centre of gravity of the athlete using the Straddle jump.
",,1,
0,b,,"  Suggest, with an explanation, why most athletes prefer to use the Fosbury flop.
",,3,
0,a,," Draw a scaled vector diagram, on the grid below, of the forces acting on point O. 
Use your diagram to determine the magnitude of the unknown weight W.

0,b,," The angles are determined by marking the positions of the strings on a sheet of paper 
behind the strings.  To improve accuracy, a mirror is placed behind each string.

0,a,," Explain how using the ramp enables a vehicle to stop.
",,2,
0,b,(i)," Show that the component of the weight of the lorry parallel to the ramp is about 5 × 10 N.
",,3,
0,c,(i)," State one advantage of building a mechanical-arrestor escape ramp compared to a 
gravity ramp.
",,1,
0,c,(ii)," Suggest why it is necessary for the steel strips to extend beyond their elastic limit.
",,2,
0,a,(i)," Use the idea of upthrust to explain why a ship would be lower in the water when loaded.
",,3,
0,a,(ii),"  Explain why the marking for tropical fresh water is higher up the side of the ship 
than the marking for tropical salt water.
",,3,
0,b,," A student devised a simple experiment to demonstrate the change in position of a ship 
when in water of different salt concentrations.
  The student placed a straw, sealed and weighted at the bottom, into a test tube 
containing distilled water.  The length of straw below the surface of the water was 
then measured.
13.3 cm
  The straw settled in a position so that the length below the surface of the water was 
13.3 cm.  The experiment was then repeated using water containing 20% salt.
  Calculate the length of straw now below the surface of the water.
−3
  density of distilled water = 998 kg m
