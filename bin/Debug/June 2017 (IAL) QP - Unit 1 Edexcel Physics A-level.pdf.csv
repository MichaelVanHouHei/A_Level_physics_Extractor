0,a,," A student investigated the motion of a small sphere falling through oil.
  The sphere was released at the top of a cylinder containing oil and measurements 
were taken to enable the terminal velocity of the sphere to be determined. 
  Describe the apparatus the student should use and the measurements to be taken. 
  The student does not have access to a motion sensor or a data logger.  You may 
include a labelled diagram in your answer.
",,5,
0,b,,"  A teacher demonstrated the motion of a small sphere falling through a vacuum and 
through oil. 
  The teacher used a motion sensor and data logger connected to a computer. 
The computer plotted graphs of velocity against time for the sphere as shown.
