0,d,," The skydiver’s jump was being filmed by another skydiver.  Both skydivers jumped 
out of the plane at the same time.  During the period of filming only the skydiver 
who was being recorded opened his parachute.
  When viewing the recording after the jump, it appeared as though the skydiver being 
filmed moved upwards as he opened his parachute.
  Explain this apparent movement.
