14,c,," The students carrying out this experiment wish to repeat it on another day using the 
same equipment.  State another relevant variable that needs to be controlled to make 
this a fair test.

15,a,," The cover is marked ‘ductile’.  It is made from ductile iron, which was invented in 
1943.  It replaced the previous form of cast iron, which was more brittle.
  Explain the meaning of the following terms:
