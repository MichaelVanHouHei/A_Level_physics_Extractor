13,a,," Explain the meanings of the terms brittle and ductile.
  Sketch stress-strain graphs and use them to illustrate your answer.
",,4,
13,b,," Give an example of a ductile material and a situation where its ductile behaviour is 
desirable.

14,a,," Use the distance-time graph to determine the speed of the object at a time of 4.0 s.
",,3,
14,b,," Calculate the acceleration.
",,2,
15,a,," Complete a free-body force diagram for the bottle.
",,2,
15,b,," The student writes the following incorrect explanation.
The force of gravity pulls the bottle down.
The bottle pushes down on the table, so by Newton’s first law, 
the table pushes up with an equal and opposite force.
According to Newton’s third law, if the forces are balanced, 
nothing can move.
  The student’s explanation contains errors.
  Rewrite the student’s explanation correctly.

   density of water = 1000 kg m
",,3,
16,a,(ii)," The study suggests a typical output for the turbine might be only 6 kW.  Suggest 
a reason for this inefficiency.

17,a,(i)," Add labelled arrows to the diagram to show the other two forces acting on a 
bubble as it rises through a liquid.
",,2,
17,a,(ii)," With reference to the forces on the bubble, explain why the bubble initially 
accelerates and then reaches a steady upwards speed.
",,4,
17,a,(iii)," Write an expression which relates these forces for a bubble moving at a steady 
upwards speed.
",,1,
17,b,(i)," Explain why it is reasonable to ignore the weight of the air.

   Use the expression to explain why the larger bubble catches up with the smaller 
one.
