0,a,(i)," Suggest what the effect would be of using springs with a greater value k when 
driving on a bumpy road.

0,b,," A	spring	used	in	the	front	suspension	of	a	car	has	an	initial	length	of	0.316	m	and	a	
new	length	of	0.205	m	when	under	a	load	of	4.07	kN.
  Calculate the spring constant of the spring.

0,a,(ii)," Write equations for the forces acting on the spider and for the forces acting on the fly.
",,2,
0,b,," The spider produces more silk, so the length of the thread of silk above the spider 
increases.  The spider and the fly both accelerate towards the ground.  
  Assuming that the mass of the silk is negligible, calculate their acceleration.

0,a,," When a man of mass 80 kg lies in the hammock, θ	is	40°.
  Show that the tension T in each of the hammock’s supporting ropes is about 650 N.  
		mass	of	hammock	and	ropes	=	4	kg
",,3,
0,b,," The force of the supporting ropes could cause the poles to fall inwards.
  By considering the vertical and horizontal components of the tension in one of the 
supporting ropes, explain why a larger value of θ creates a smaller force on the poles 
supporting the hammock.
