0,a,," Describe how the student could use a graphical method to determine the spring 
constant of the spring.
",,3,
0,b,," State two ways in which this method contributes to an accurate value for the spring 
constant.
",,2,
0,a,,"	A	student	suggests	that	the	work	done	on	the	block	is	ΔW = 15 N × 0.050 m.
  Explain why this suggestion is not correct.
",,2,
0,b,," When the spring is compressed by 0.060 m the tension in the spring is 18 N.
  The mass is held in this position and then released.
  The block now moves along the frictionless surface, losing contact with the spring 
once the spring has reached its original length.
  Calculate the velocity of the block after it loses contact with the spring.

0,a,," Explain why the bubbles rise faster through the magma as they start to expand.
",,3,
0,b,," The table shows three types of magma: basaltic, andesitic and rhyolitic.
Magma type Viscosity
basaltic low
andesitic medium
rhyolitic high
  Explain through which magma type the bubbles will rise with the greatest velocity.

0,c,," The magma cools as it reaches the surface of the Earth.
  State how cooling affects the magma.

0,a,(ii)," Explain, using Newton’s laws of motion, how the ejection of water at high speed 
results in the forward propulsion of the jet ski.

0,a,(i)," The launcher is initially set to release balls at a speed of 30 m s at an angle of 25° 
to the horizontal.
   State and explain two ways in which the launcher can be adjusted to increase the 
time of flight of the ball.

0,b,(i)," Explain why the detector records a velocity that is less than the actual velocity.
",,2,
0,b,(ii)," Using the values given in the diagram, calculate the percentage error in the 
recorded velocity.

0,c,," A student claims that a small coin, if dropped from a tall building, can cause serious 
injury were it to land on a person.
  A second student claims that this would only be the case had the coin been falling 
through a vacuum.
  Show that a coin falling through a distance of 305 m through a vacuum would reach 
the ground at a speed over 5 times faster than a coin falling this distance through air 
in position X.

0,a,(i)," Calculate the total force of the wire on the tooth to move the tooth in the direction 
shown.
",,2,
0,a,(ii)," Explain why the wire will not produce any movement of the tooth perpendicular 
to the direction shown.
